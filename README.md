Welcome! 👋
Glad you landed here!

I’m Payal — an engineer by craft, a mentor by passion, and a lifelong learner with a soft spot for debugging both code and chaos. This site is where I share my professional journey, some proud moments, a few lessons learned the hard way, and highlights from talks, mentorships, patents, and the occasional “how-did-I-end-up-here” adventure.

Think of this as a curated highlight reel with just enough personality to keep it real. Thanks for stopping by — and feel free to say hi!

📬 Feel free to reach me at godhanipayal@gmail.com — I’d love to connect.
